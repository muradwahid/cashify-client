                The Four Kinds of React State to Manage
              </h4>
              <p>
                <strong>1. Local (UI) state-- </strong>
                Local state is data we manage in one or another component. Local
                state is most often managed in React using the useState hook.
                For example, local state would be needed to show or hide a modal
                component or to track values for a form component, such as form
                submission, when the form is disabled and the values of a formâ€™s
                inputs.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>2. Global (UI) state-- </strong>
                Global state is data we manage across multiple components.
                Global state is necessary when we want to get and update data
                anywhere in our app, or in multiple components at least. A
                common example of global state is authenticated user state. If a
                user is logged into our app, it is necessary to get and change
                their data throughout our application. Sometimes state we think
                should be local might become global.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>3. Server state-- </strong>
                Data that comes from an external server that must be integrated
                with our UI state. Server state is a simple concept, but can be
                hard to manage alongside all of our local and global UI state.
                There are several pieces of state that must be managed every
                time you fetch or update data from an external server, including
                loading and error state. Fortunately there are tools such as SWR
                and React Query that make managing server state much easier.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>4. URL state-- </strong>
                Data that exists on our URLs, including the pathname and query
                parameters. URL state is often missing as a category of state,
                but it is an important one. In many cases, a lot of major parts
                of our application rely upon accessing URL state. Try to imagine
                building a blog without being able to fetch a post based off of
                its slug or id that is located in the URL! There are undoubtedly
                more pieces of state that we could identify, but these are the
                major categories worth focusing on for most applications you
                build.

              How does prototypical inheritance work?

              <p>
                The Prototypal Inheritance is a feature in javascript used to
                add methods and properties in objects. It is a method by which
                an object can inherit the properties and methods of another
                object. Traditionally, in order to get and set the [[Prototype]]
                of an object, we use Object. getPrototypeOf and Object.

              <p>
                The main objective of unit testing is to isolate written code to
                test and determine if it works as intended. Unit testing is an
                important step in the development process, because if done
                correctly, it can help detect early flaws in code which may be
                more difficult to find in later testing stages.

                Vue provides higher customizability and hence is easier to learn
                than Angular or React. Further, Vue has an overlap with Angular
                and React with respect to their functionality like the use of
                components. Hence, the transition to Vue from either of the two
                is an easy option.
